This depository contains differents python tools created during my internship at the IRIT. It allows to:
- prepare a dataset for instance segmentation using CNN models: image_processing.py
- run and represent predictions with loaded CNN models: forward.py
- execute basic transfer learning on UNET: combination_transfer_learning.py and unique_transfer_learning.py

An open-sourced dataset of breast cancer ultrasound images is also provided. It comes from https://aapm.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/mp.12538.
